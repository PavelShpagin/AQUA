# Examples with LLM Reasoning

1. OF-306 and getting fired That would be flagged, and security would call me. (missing_errors:1/3) [LLM: FN, Human: TN] [LLM_reasoning: The corrected sentence lacks clear punctuation to separate the phrase 'OF-306 and getting fired' from the subsequent sentence 'That would be flagged, and security would call me.' A period or semicolon is required after 'fired' to correctly connect the clauses, indicating two separate sentences.]

2. Question About Budget Cuts and Job Promises Nordic countries have strong private sectors that are **{rich as a nation=>sufficiently wealthy:::llm_TP:::human_TP(TP:2)}** to support their economies **{not their own=>without relying on their:::llm_TP:::human_TP(TP:2)}** governments. [LLM: FN, Human: FN] [LLM_reasoning: The phrase 'rich as a nation' was awkward and could be misinterpreted; 'sufficiently wealthy' clarifies the intended meaning without altering the core information. The change from 'not their own' to 'without relying on their' corrects an ambiguous phrase, providing clear intent that private sectors do not depend on government support. However, there is a remaining issue at the start, where 'Question About Budget Cuts and Job Promises' appears as a standalone fragment, lacking coherence with the subsequent sentence.]

3. **{Visiting=>When visiting:::llm_TP:::human_FP1(FP1:1,TP:1)}** Latvia for the first time,**{proper etiquette and some questions Dont smile too much.=>it's important to understand proper etiquette and address some common questions.:::llm_FP2:::human_FP1(FP1:1,TP:1)}** [LLM: FP2, Human: FP1] [LLM_reasoning: The first edit effectively introduces a dependent clause for the sentence, making it a grammatically complete and coherent main clause. The second edit changes the header-like fragment into a full sentence but alters the original meaning significantly by omitting 'Don't smile too much,' which might have conveyed a specific etiquette suggestion. This omission changes the intended content and therefore can be classified as an FP2 rather than a preferred correction. The sentence transformation leads to a significant loss of the intended meaning, indicating a missed error.]

4. Roasted with some cheaper cuts of meat on the weekend. (missing_errors:0/3) [LLM: FN, Human: TN] [LLM_reasoning: The original sentence 'Roasted with some cheaper cuts of meat on the weekend.' is not a complete sentence; it lacks a subject and verb. Without any changes, it remains a fragment. A possible correction could include a subject and verb to form a complete sentence, such as 'We roasted some cheaper cuts of meat on the weekend.']
